Step one is to create a [beacon in cyberspace](/cyberspace). Focus on:

- Local [language](/language)
- Local culture
- Bitcoin only

A podcast is easy to do usually works well. But this could also be a newsletter, or YouTube channel, or similar. The important part is that this should be a beacon in [cyberspace](/cyberspace), not something in meatspace.

## Podcast

Create a beacon. Start a podcast. It has never been easier to start a podcast.
It is the perfect beacon because it is personal and easy to produce. 

Here are some formats that usually work well:

* Weekly news roundup, as championed with [RHR] by TFTC
* Interviews, as done by [Stephan Livera][SLP]
* Readings of books and articles, as championed by [Bitcoin Audible][BA]
* Answering the question, “How did you find your way to Bitcoin?”, as championed by “[Der Weg][DW]”

[BA]: https://bitcoinaudible.com/
[DW]: https://einundzwanzig.space/podcast/der-weg/

Start with one of these and do it in your native language. Weekly news roundups and reading translations is probably easiest. 

Episode frequency will depend on format and time commitment. Weekly or bi-weekly is good.
