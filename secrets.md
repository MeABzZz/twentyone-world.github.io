There's not one, not two, but three secrets. Okay, maybe four:

1. [Don't do it alone](/blueprint#team-up)
2. Focus on your [language](/language) and your culture
3. Start with [cyberspace first](/cyberspace)
4. Consistency, consistency, consistency

Whatever you do, stick with it for [21 weeks](/secrets).
